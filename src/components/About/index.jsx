        <h1>Bio</h1>
        <p>
        I am a second year student based in Dunedin at the University of Otago, 
        studying a Bachelor of Applied Science Majoring Software Engineering and 
        a Minor in Information Science. 
        You will find me to be a hardworking, organized, self-motivated and a responsible employee with an approachable and outgoing attitude. 
        I enjoy getting to know others and find myself capable of easily communicating to others. 
        I also prioritise presenting myself well and maintaining a professional attitude.

        I am hard working and very passionate about gaining knowledge. Whatever the task I may be assigned, 
        I do with full passion and concentration, and I complete the task within the timeframe.
        In my spare time I like to experiment and learn about more languages, and keep up-to-date with 
        the newest technology in order to help better my knowledge of Software Development.
